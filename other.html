                            GAZE partners with The Complex to present new queer film in a gallery setting as an 
                            official part of our international LGBTQ+ film programme for the first time. Our 
                            programme has been curated from work by local, national and international artists 
                            and will include artists in conversation. All events are free to attend.

                            Filmmakers explore the ground that we walk on, the way that we tread, and the 
                            things that we move through. The works in TERRAIN are concerned with the queer 
                            body in place and space, generating films that are sensitive, sensual and satirical.

                                <br>Dir. Rodrigo de Oliveira
                                <br>1h 47m </em>

                            The early days of AIDS brought such losses that a true cultural reckoning of those times has been hard to come by, not least because so many of the best storytellers were among the fallen.
 
                            Russell T. Davies' It's A Sin brought the pandemic back into public consciousness, and Rodrigo de Oliveira's The First Fallen goes deeper with unflinching directorial imagination, resulting in a narrative full of rage and beauty as three friends prepare to face a new and awful inevitability.
                             
                            Among the many special things about the film is a rare centering of trans experience in an AIDS narrative, for which Renata Carvalho's portrayal of Rose establishes an unforgettable voice. Johnny Massaro's Suzano is tender-hearted and courageous and reminds us of so many lost and eternally young.
                             
                            It would mean nothing to celebrate 30 years of LGBTQ+ cinema without time and space for a reflection on HIV and AIDS. On Thursday we also screen Irish hybrid-documentary work How To Tell A Secret to bring the conversation on HIV right up to date.

                             dive into the endless imagination of LGBTQ+ filmmakers. An odyssey of thrills, chills, 
                             and musical numbers.

                            Prepare to repeatedly gasp in awe as all your favourite literary lesbians grace the screen in new interviews and magical archival footage in a superlative documentary that traces the journey of Sapphic writing from the last century.
 
                            Evans and Martin leave few stones unturned as their story winds from The Well Of Loneliness to queer kids' books, via porn, crime, horror, and the lesbian pulp novel explosion that was radically co-opted by real life lesbians themselves.
                             
                            The memories, struggles, anecdotes and triumphs come thick and fast as Alice Walker, Rita Mae Brown, Jewelle Gomez and Sarah Waters join a sprawling cast who chart a triumphant literary tale. 
                            
                            Dublin's bookstores had better just stock up and watch out after this screening.

                            In Gotham City, you're either a jokeman or a harlequin. Comedy is a controlled substance and Smylex addictions are rising. But one rebellious, unfunny, transgender clown called Joker is ready to fight the system‚Äîjust as soon as she legally changes her name to Joker The Harlequin, creates a good comedy act, and deals with her toxic boyfriend, Jared Leto's Joker.

                            From Tim and Eric editor Vera Drew comes a bombastic mix of anti-comedy, animation and transexual clowns made with the help of over 100 artists and with zero authorisation from DC Comics.

                            <br><br>
                            For over 25 years, partners in life, art and creativity Paco and Manolo, have published Kink Magazine, a photo-journal of ordinary queer men who want to get naked in front of their cameras.
 
                            Singles, couples, shy guys and outright exhibitionists all take their turn in front of the lens as the artists debate and divulge what keeps their practice fresh and their readership dedicated.  
                            
                            The imagery in Kink skates the line between art and pornography, as does this film, but for the models it's a chance to explore a new side of themselves, to celebrate their bodies, declare their sexuality and join the growing pantheon of legendary Kink boys before them.
                            
                            This frank and detailed documentary leaves nothing unsaid or unseen as Paco and Manolo meet, photograph and immortalise a new generation of nude guys.

                            <em>'There was nothing published about the culture and sociology of the gay community. I knew I was risking my career.'</em>
                            <br><br>
                            In an era when gay and lesbian culture was trivialised and pathologised, or at best ignored, Esther Newton broke new ground applying anthropological techniques to the study of drag queens and gay bars, insisting on the validity of gay culture as a unique existence that mattered.

                            As a young butch lesbian in pre-Stonewall and pre-Women's Liberation America, Newton tread a pioneering path that impacted on generations to follow.

                            Beautifully entwining lesbian intellectualism with drag herstory, Carlomusto's film posits a closeness in our collective queer past that will feel nostalgic for some and inspirational for others. As Esther says of her affinity with drag queens, 'I felt like I had been a female impersonator my whole life.''
                            
                            The archive material from a pre-Gay Liberation drag underground is incredible to behold, not to mention the eye-opening insights into the lesbian-powered world of dog agility contests, of course.

                            Experimental sex, love and identity blossom wildly in the Berlin underground among a circle of sexy dykes and gender-bending freewheelers.
 
                            Cheryl Dunye's place in history was assured by her 1996 milestone The Watermelon Woman, the first Black Lesbian feature, and a film that proved timeless enough to hardly age at all.
                            
                            Mommy Is Coming is a far cry in theme and content but maintains the same joyful queerness in not only its subject matter but its inventiveness and irreverence for formal boundaries, plus Dunye's trademark refusal to curtail female sexualities of all persuasions.
                            
                            Released in GAZE's 20th year, this seems a fine time for us to look back and dream of Sapphic high-jinx, group kinks and lesbian kicks in that queerest of queer cities, Berlin.

                            The seven unexpected encounters in The Art of Cruising transport the viewer from late night 
                            carpark trysts, to the hot city at dawn, to petty street crime with an erotic twist, to man-on-man 
                            encounters in nature, plus a literal/metaphorical cruise into masculinity itself. Optional trip

                            The waterways of Venice form a sensuous backdrop for the journey of a gondolier 
                            that is both physical and metaphorical.

                            To celebrate GAZE's 30th birthday, we're asking the audience to choose what to watch on Saturday 
                            night! We've been asking GAZE-goers to tell us their favourite GAZE memory, or what film defines 
                            queer cinema for them, and we're putting together a shortlist for our wonderful community to chose from.

                            Some of our audience want to see classics like Trick (1999), Orlando (1992), or The Killing of 
                            Sister George (1968), while others are eager to revisit modern classics like Call Me By Your 
                            Name (2017), Pride (2014) and Tomboy (2011). And, of course, many want to relive their favourite 
                            GAZE screenings, hoping to see The Novice (2021), Strella (2009), or Beautiful Thing (1996) on 
                            the big screen once again.

                            The shortlist will be announced on the GAZE website and social media in the lead up to the 
                            festival, so check out @GazeFlimFest on Twitter and Instagram as well as our Facebook page, 
                            cast your vote wisely, and don't miss out on the opportunity to have your say!

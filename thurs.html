                            This ground-breaking film takes on the enormity and complexity of HIV in Ireland with rigorous honesty, ingenuity and artistry that propels the conversation forward.
                            
                            People in Ireland living with HIV share experiences with disarming emotional generosity and multiple creative means, making room for rage, acceptance, catastrophe and love along the way.
                            
                            Mixing new documentary work and archival footage with verbatim theatre, lip sync and a non-linear film style, this is queer story-telling at its best. Veda's embodiment of the Diceman, Thom McGinty, is surely one of the most iconic visions of queer Ireland yet captured on film.
                            
                            This is the HIV film Ireland has been waiting for.

                             For almost thirty years the Red Army Faction, aka Baader Meinhof Gang, terrorised the capitalist powers-that-be of Germany.
                            
                            Dagmar (Linda Sixt) is one of the final gang members to remain on the run, unable to conform or to imagine an existence beyond bank robberies, false names and hideouts.
                            
                            Her teenage daughter Clara (Alida Stricker) is inescapably caught up in their renegade existence, longing for a life of normality, and yearning to be with her second mother Samira who has made a break from the criminal underworld, for now at least.
                            
                            As Clara navigates her own burgeoning queer desire and begins to taste genuine freedom for the first time, conflicts ensue that are way beyond typical adolescent friction.
                            
                            With taut dialogue, nail-biting heist scenes and a gorgeous queer nightclub sequence, Generation Tochter sets a sophisticated standard for lesbian thrillers to come.

                            Our collective cultural obsession with all things downtown and dirty from pre-gentrification New York City is supremely catered for by the insanely high drama of Make Me Famous.
 
                            Manhattan is still in thrall to ultimate Art God, Andy Warhol, and in an era where you can't swing a paint can without hitting a new artist, the unknown painter Edward Brezinski wants to make it big.
                             
                            While rising stars like Jean-Michel Basquiat and Keith Haring emerge from the party-n-paint lifestyle of the East Village and Lower East Side, Brezinski's tale is a campy yet earnest expose of what it took to survive the rough and tumble of America's last great art explosion.
                             
                            The film includes never before seen archive video of the 1980s art scene, including clips of the era's most influential art films, while the archival footage of Manhattan at its grimy and glamorous best has to be seen to be believed.

                            This year we foreground our festival mission to celebrate 'the art of film' with shorts

                            Cruising, The Art of Experience and The Art of Dress actively queer each of our themes to 
                            bring you diverse selections of new shorts that shine a light on the sheer artistry of LGBTQ+ lives.

                            Ranging through sci-fi, fantasy, horror and more, the genre films in The Art of Imagination
                             dive into the endless imagination of LGBTQ+ filmmakers. An odyssey of thrills, chills, 
                             and musical numbers.

                            This year we foreground our festival mission to celebrate 'the art of film' with shorts programmes 
                            that gleefully play with theme and content. The Art of Imagination, The Art of Cruising, The 
                            Art of Experience and The Art of Dress actively queer each of our themes to bring you diverse 
                            selections of new shorts that shine a light on the sheer artistry of LGBTQ+ lives.
 
                            The seven unexpected encounters in The Art of Cruising transport the viewer from late night 
                            carpark trysts, to the hot city at dawn, to petty street crime with an erotic twist, to man-on-man 
                            encounters in nature, plus a literal/metaphorical cruise into masculinity itself. Optional trip 
                            to the Phoeno after.

                            Time and ageing are tricky topics for LGBTQ+ people but these filmmakers explore them with panache, 
                            ingenuity and hilarity in equal measure. Their films look at nostalgia, ageing, passion, community, 
                            loneliness and collective futures from a range of dynamic viewpoints that honour queer experience.

                            Soaring high above Beirut, a Syrian migrant working 
                            on a dangerous crane finally feels free from the 
                            shackles of masculinity.

                            GAZE are excited to partner with aemi for a third time to present a programme of 
                            Irish and international experimental shorts. The films in this programme look at 
                            constructs of identity, particularly as these relate to ideas of queer identity, 
                            evoking ways in which aspects of our past can be dismantled while others are re-made
                             or unmade from the stories we tell or are told of ourselves. With a focus to some 
                             degree on a wide variety of experiences of childhood and coming of age, this screening
                              offers reflections on transitions and interior lives made manifest, drawing out 
                              compelling relationships between past and future, truth and fiction.

                            Masc.ing uses a music video format, drawing from 90s MTV 
                            aesthetics as well as everyday domestic objects that can 
                            be perceived as queer, to explore a transition from boy to man.

                            Set in the Andean nation of Bolivia, Angelo is about a 
                            shoeshine boy who uses the power of his imagination to 
                            escape the harsh reality of life on the street.

                            Language folds and falls in on itself in this new video work 
                            by artist duo Cat and &Eacute;im&eacute;ar McClay. Animated 3D tableaus of 
                            Catholic paraphernalia and strikes of elemental weather accompany 
                            the words. Together, they enact the historically fraught relationship 
                            between queerness and the Catholic church.

                            After finding video material of her childhood, the director 
                            reprogrammes her mythology as an infant and reflects on her 
                            body traversed by affections, fictions and years.

                            approaches the construction and dematerialization of the artist while 
                            asking where our intentions take root when we attempt to create anything at all.

                            Suicidal, or just a working class queer caught in the wrong underpants?

                            video based on actual meetings with hospital staff while in a psychiatric hospital system.

                            Two boyfriends wander beaches near New York City, finding shade under 
                            crude shelters they build with sheets, rubber bands, and materials 
                            (like driftwood) scavenged from the shore.

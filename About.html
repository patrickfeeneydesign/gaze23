                        <p>Welcome to the 30th edition of GAZE International LGBTQ+ Film Festival! Since its foundation 30 years ago. GAZE has been creating spaces for our community to come together to celebrate queer cinema, share common cultural experiences, and to see our stories represented on the big screen. GAZE has been a platform for emerging and established LGBTQ+ filmmakers to showcase their work, as well as an advocate for deeper understanding of the breadth and complexity of our communities.
                            <br><br>
                            It is very easy for those who look at us from the outside to take a simplistic view of what it means to be LGBTQ+ but the reality is that we are a diverse community of communities. At GAZE, we aim to be representative in our programming to ensure that all voices within our communities are heard. This is no easy task and I want to commend our programming team, led by Festival Director Greg Thorpe, who have curated an exciting programme of features, short films, and documentaries that demonstrate and celebrate our diversity. We are really excited this year that our festival extends beyond the usual five days with a gallery programme in partnership with The Complex that runs on after the cinema programme, as well as an online programme of screenings that helps us to engage with audiences around the island.
                            <br><br>
                            We are also excited that we have been able to begin to support LGBTQ+ film artists by creating opportunities for filmmakers to come together and share their work, along with offering some bursaries to support their career development. We look forward to these initiatives bearing fruit in future editions of the festival!
                            I want to express my grateful thanks to Greg, Alice and James, for curating such a magnificent programme for us to enjoy. I want to also thank Caoimhe for her work as Festival Manager. The Light House and IFI are always a joy to work with and we are delighted that they can host us again this year, along with The Complex. I must also acknowledge the dedication of our Festival Board who give so generously of their time and expertise all year round.
                            <br><br>
                            GAZE would not be possible without the generous financial support of our funders. We are very grateful to the Arts Council for supporting our ambitions to grow the festival as we work towards a new strategic plan. Thanks also to the Broadcasting Authority of Ireland for their continued support this year. We are also deeply grateful to Accenture, our main sponsor, for their loyal support. We are proud to partner with Accenture and to share a common goal of advancing inclusion through diversity. To all our sponsors, funders, advertisers, and especially to our Festival Friends: thank you!
                            <br><br>
                            I hope that you will find something that speaks to you in this year's programme. I look forward to seeing many of you during the festival and to raising a glass to celebrate GAZE in this milestone 30th year!

                            Another stellar year for the Irish short. We were overwhelmed with the high standard of storytelling on 
                            display and the sheer pool of talent that's out there. Be sure to check out the rest of the programme for
                             more Irish shorts popping up across the festival as pre-feature screenings. Last year we had a packed house
                              for this celebration of Irish filmmaking, this year we want to sell out completely so come along, bring a friend, 
                              and stick around to chat with the artists afterwards. If you'd prefer to experience a relaxed screening of this 
                              selection in a smaller venue, turn to the Saturday line-up for more info, plus you will have chance to see Irish 
                              shorts as part of GAZE Online. Wherever you choose to watch, enjoy!

                                Emer Danagher is a school girl in rural Ireland who is battling with the overwhelming agony of 
                                unrequited love. We see her build up the courage to come clean to her crush as she realises that 
                                she has nothing to lose and everything to gain. But at 17, it feels like her life will be over if she
                                 doesn't get the response she so desperately wants.

                            Drag queens are so often fierce, funny, fabulous, and surrounded by fanatics - but how often are they the real 
                            object of desire, of love, lust and intimacy? Three NIghts A Week follows a confused young man's life as it gets 
                            turned upside down and covered in sequins when he falls for a hardworking drag star with a tough veneer and a 
                            vulnerable interior. 

                            The looks and turns throughout this uplifting feature are to die for, and the dialogue snaps hard in a witty and 
                            fast rollercoaster of laughs and lipstick. The backdrop of gay nightclubs, queer cabaret, hedonism and HIV activism 
                            gives this film an authentically queer setting for a totally unconventional romance to unfold. France excels at both 
                            the contemporary queer drama and sophisticated rom-com, and Three Nights A Week is the very best of both - something 
                            to give your Friday night all of the necessary glamour and romance. J'adore.

                                Darcelle, at the age of 91, is the Guinness World Record holder for the oldest 
                                working drag queen. On stage Darcelle is harolded as a prominent figure in the Portland, 
                                Oregon LGBTQ+ scene but at home Walter Cole is just like anyone else who loves, laughs, and 
                                cries. In this short film, friends and family reflect with Darcelle on a long and accomplished 
                                life as the end draws near.

                                Queer people from all around the world have helped make Berlin what it is today. 
                                Many LGBTQIA people leave their home and make their way to Berlin because they want to, 
                                others because they have to. Queer life in Berlin means exploring what freedom can be and 
                                fighting for it when the time comes. Director Jochen Hick's sensitive and intimate documentary 
                                follows a few of these queer life experiences, exploring the interactions of queer Berliners with
                                their new or native city as they navigate work, play, gender, transition, change, language, pleasure
                                and activism.

                                QUEER EXILE BERLIN is the third in a trilogy of thorough and artistic historical and cultural explorations 
                                of the queerest city on Earth. The queer universe of Berlin mirrors the movements of the world and is constantly 
                                evolving. The film interweaves personal stories and ambitions of queer protagonists with historical events and 
                                current issues. The result is a true image of Berlin as a perpetual place of longing and a challenge to all those
                                 who arrive there. A city in constant transition. How do you make a life in Berlin? Come and see for yourself.

                                hockey goalie from a troubled but loving home. Her family shares a chilling supernatural secret that ultimately 
                                cannot be kept hidden as Heather begins to assert her sexuality upon meeting the beautiful neighbourhood girl Jonny,
                                 played with enigmatic perfection by Amandla Stenberg of The Hunger Games, The Hate U Give and Bodies Bodies Bodies.

                                As their relationship deepens and her parental troubles accelerate, the dark power that lives inside Heather will soon
                                 be unleashed. The 1980s setting for this brilliant teen horror allows for  a sensational soundtrack and a super-cool 
                                 Stranger Things aesthetic that you will adore.

                                Sue and Ellie share an unspoken love that is gradually transforming into something much deeper, sweeter and more 
                                meaningful. Often when we are the ones closest to the truth, we are the very last people to see it.

                                Ask Any Buddy was an Irish Premiere at GAZE back in the home-viewing days of 2020. 
                                This unique cine-collage is a voyage into the classic porn of yesteryear and it's had a 
                                film festival life like few other movies. For GAZE 2023 we are bringing it back for a glorious
                                 in-the-flesh late night screening.

                                Both erotic and anthropological, Purchell's filmic essay is a kaleidoscope of beautiful men from 
                                bygone days. Filled with the warmth of grainy pre-digital footage and the hot pulse of disco, it 
                                pieces together work by famous adult directors, including William Higgins, Tom DeSimone and Joe Gage.
                                 Elements of 126 feature films, spanning the years 1968-1986, go to create a cut-up of urban gay life 
                                 and a snapshot from a different time.
                                
                                Ask Any Buddy is a joyful homage to the radical act of being a happy and fulfilled homosexual, and to 
                                the gleeful smut-makers who captured the nightlife, the cruising, the baths and the fun.

                                Cult filmmaker Tom DeSimone revisits the production of a lost gay porn film, resurrecting 
                                youthful adventures on the Californian coast, but nostalgia isn't always 20/20 vision.

                                <br>Dir. Peter McDowell

                            <em>'When he came home from Vietnam, he didn't wanna stay, he was gonna go back'</em>
                            <br><br>
 
                            Gay film director Peter McDowell was only 5 years old when his enigmatic older brother Jimmy died in Saigon having returned to Vietnam as a civilian after his US military service.
 
                            Why did he go back? What happened to Jimmy in Vietnam? And how did he die?
                            
                            An uneasy veil of family silence around Jimmy's story prompts Peter to embark on a journey of questioning with a trusty camera in tow. Through hundreds of Jimmy's letters, long-kept secrets and an unexpectedly close-to-home revelation, the truth about Jimmy’s life and death delivers a startling real-time documentary triumph.
                            
                            A decade in the making, spanning continents, with a lifetime of questioning to make up for, Jimmy In Saigon is a heart-wrenching but ultimately life-affirming reconciliation with the truth.
                            
                            If you believe life is stranger than fiction, and you like a good weep, you should let Jimmy In Saigon into your heart.

                            Before anti-retrovirals, before Morrissey went batshit, before 'Bad Gays' were bad and GAZE was even 'GAZE'. there was Gregg Araki's The Living End.
 
                            Released the same year GAZE was born, this is a perfect chance for us to delve back into a genuine queer classic, and just like us, it's looking damn good for 30.
                             
                            Araki totally corrupts the iconic American road movie template with his nihilistic HIV positive pansy and punk duo, ripping up the present like there's no tomorrow, because there really wasn't.
                             
                            With an irresistible lexicon of guns, muscles and Smiths posters, and a soundtrack to kill for, The Living End spoke to an angry young queer generation who were about to get their own new wave of cinema and an attitude that was well and truly earned.
                            
                            Absolutely fuck everything.

                                <br>Dir. Leonardo Brzezicki

                            An incredibly persuasive orgy scene sets the tone for Brzezicki's deep-dive into a sexy gay existentialist crisis.
 
                            Santiago (Leonardo Sbaraglia) is handsome, horny, hung, and hungover. He's also a father, a lost soul, and just about old enough to know better.
                            
                            As he beds a succession of gorgeous men not much older than his daughter Laila, the real love of his life, Laila herself, is gradually slipping through his fingers.
                            
                            The intense family drama at the heart of this feisty narrative stops it from becoming another gay pills and party escapade, and the tension/adoration between father and daughter is magnificently portrayed.
                            
                            That's not to say the hedonism isn't irresistible. If the stark naked George Michael karaoke, or the best cinematic group sex since Shortbus doesn't satisfy you, maybe your own minor crisis is just around the corner.

                            From screen bans to a place in the Library of Congress, the half-century journey of the abominably good Pink Flamingos is the history of underground cinema itself, loathed and revered in equal measures (it was even profiled in Vogue this year). It's hard to believe this delve into the glorious grotesque was already twenty years old when GAZE got started.
 
                            It is iconic beyond anyone's wildest dreams, and its stars, “The Filthiest People Alive”, and their antics, could only have come from the filth-genius mind of director John Waters. His fabulously shambolic underground stars make Warhol's seem like actual Hollywood royalty by contrast, and they're out in full force here, including Mink Stole and Edith Massey.
                            
                            But it's clearly Divine who rules this filthy universe and the outrageousness of her antics will shock you like the very first time. 'There's just two kinds of people, Miss Sandstone, my kind of people, and assholes!''
                            
                            In an age of increasing conservatism and gate-keeping, the faint-of-heart are exactly who should be watching this movie. Bring your own barf bags.

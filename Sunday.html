                                aficionado and cinephile? Living in Ireland or just passing through Dublin for the festival? 
                                Come and join us for a relaxed pre-cinema festival social hosted by Festival Director Greg Thorpe
                                 where you can get a coffee, chat about cinema, swap your top tips for the festival, and meet other 
                                 filmmakers. The social will take place at the Light House Cinema and all are welcome. 

                                If you need any kind of assistance to attend, are feeling shy, or would like to know more before you 
                                come along, just email julian@gaze.ie. Looking forward to meeting you all for festival gossip and 
                                networking. Please note there will be a second Filmmaker Social at the same time on Sunday also at 
                                Light House Cinema.

                                    The chill of distant Finland is a recurring metaphor in this magical realist 
                                    feature, but it's the deep sun-drenched heart of rural Mexico that forms the 
                                    setting, with its unreal light, ancient traditions and spiritual symbolism. 
                                    The muxes are the focus of Horacio Alcal√°'s story, a community of people who 
                                    live between genders, and the director uses every tool in the filmmaker's 
                                    armoury to bring these vivid outsiders to the screen with tenderness, 
                                    authenticity, respect and majesty.
 
                                    As the muxes community struggles to keep body and soul together, the encroaching
                                     forces of capitalism, colonialism, time, binary gender and eventually Mother Nature
                                      herself seem to be pitched against them. This is a story of spirit, tradition and 
                                      love. There are moments so visually stunning that time - another key theme of the 
                                      story - seems to stand still. Swathes of colour, breath-taking mise en scene, pin 
                                      sharp dialogue and a luxurious love of light and shade make this a genuine piece of
                                       art. This is a rare chance to appreciate this level of filmmaking on a big screen.

                        2023 marks the fourth consecutive year of aemi and GAZE working together 
                        to present a programme of moving image work by artists and experimental filmmakers as
                        part of the festival. This packed line-up moves from the earthly to the celestial to assert 
                        political dissent, express longing and physical desire, evoke the stranger facets of human intimacy 
                        and celebrate the healing strength of joy, community and creativity. As a programme made up entirely
                         of brand new work this screening hopefully says something about the specifics of this often contradictory
                          moment in time and the more lucid perspectives it can sometimes give us on the past, in all its chaos 
                          and complexity.

                                    Join us in the suitably sumptuous surrounds of The Stella Cinema to celebrate the centenary 
                                    of Salom√©. Try saying that after a martini. This legendary silent film based on the original 
                                    Oscar Wilde play has a long and controversial history and a juicy enticing queer mythology that
                                     would've made Oscar proud.
 
                                    Co-directed by Charles Bryant with fabulous bisexual artist, actress, author and bon viveur, 
                                    Alla Nazimova, the film was rumoured to feature an entirely gay cast of actors (spot the irresistible
                                     camping about), and boasts drag artists, decadence and of course dramatic decapitation! All s
                                     ensitively done, of course.
                                     
                                    
                                    
                                    
                                    The spartan sets paired with sumptuous avant-garde costuming - far ahead of its time - draw
                                     on original illustrations by Aubrey Beardsley from Wilde's play text, and the film itself 
                                     now seems tantalisingly close to the era of dear Oscar.

                                            Onyeka Igwe. Scripted by Lemmey and narrated by Ben Whishaw, Ungentle is a major new film 
                                            commission exploring the knotty and intriguing relationship between the history of British
                                             espionage and male homosexuality, juxtaposing anonymous memoir with carefully crafted imagery 
                                             hinting at symbolic attachments and a lost past.
 
                                            Ungentle's unseen protagonist recalls his young life and subsequent recruitment into the world
                                             of intelligence agencies, relating experiences of subterfuge, community, sexual and state secrecy
                                              between gay men and spies. Ungentle draws on the life stories of infamous Cambridge Five 'traitors'
                                               Anthony Blunt and Guy Burgess, and civil servant John Vassall. These Cold War-era scandals featuring
                                                gay men linked homosexuality with betrayal in popular imagination. What emerges is a portrait of 
                                                the often contradictory self-perceptions which marked 'Englishness', sexuality, and class in the

                                Hedda is beautiful, aristocratic, and intelligent, loaded with social grace and a steely, clear, dispassionate charisma. 
                                Life really isn't good enough for Hedda. Like any of us, in life there are moments when we feel that this frustrating 
                                business of existence ‚Äî as lived on our darkest days ‚Äî really isn't good enough for us either‚Ä¶
                                Set in a Lynchian world of dream imagery, drama, bespoke sound design, music and chanteuse style singing; the iconic 
                                avant-garde performer David Hoyle stars as Hedda in this one-person, cinematic/theatrical reimagining of Henrik Ibsen's 
                                Hedda Gabler, created and directed by Jen Heyes, with original composition by Tom Parkinson. HEDDA (After Ibsen) moves 
                                past the obvious to create a darkly surreal show for everyone that doesn't reduce it to our binary traditions. Shot on
                                 location at Soho Theatre, yet cinematically ambitious, HEDDA (After Ibsen) is a story of many faces - the absolute power 
                                 of manipulation, influence, the control of obsession and dark psychological unrest. This is a contemporary unpacking of
                                  Ibsen's original text from 
                                
                                
                                inside the hinterland of the artist's imagination. Heyes and Hoyle's reimagined Hedda is both musical and darkly 
                                surreal, moving us far beyond the traditional binary. As Ibsen himself said: 'Hedda is first and foremost a human 
                                being.'

                                to have been born on the same day. They meet to collaborate on a portrait of Libro and discuss their lives from 
                                the 1980s onwards. Now, after 3 years, Sadie is ready to uncover the painting. This short documentary follows Sadie 
                                and Libro's friendship and the surprising reveal.

                                As a young trans woman named Ren (Carmen Madonia) anxiously slips into a rest stop bathroom, our shoulders 
                                hike with fear for her; but Ren is only nervous because she has taken up vaping again and is trying to hide
                                 it from her overbearing mother. It's easy to see why Something You Said Last Night has been called 'subversive' 
                                 and 'revolutionary' for depicting a trans character in quiet, everyday situations without dwelling on her identity.
                                  But it would be a disservice to only highlight what this film doesn't have.

                                In a painfully intimate film so full of Ren's character that she threatens to walk off the screen, out of the cinema, 
                                and over to Gay Spar for a new vape cartridge, De Filippis has created a minutely observed version of the 2020s 
                                coming-of-age film. Following Ren, her headstrong younger sister and her chipper Italian parents on a family vacation,
                                 Luis De Filippis' feature debut is rife with the quotidian tensions that make and break our relationships every day. 
                                 A twenty-something artist tries to make the transition to adulthood while fearing life outside the family nest. An 
                                 absent brother looms over birthday celebrations. Petty arguments turn into shouting matches. Playful teasing leads 
                                 to a smashed phone. Little apologies bring declarations of unconditional love.

                                Beware the Almamula‚Ä¶ This deeply atmospheric queer drama from Argentina creeps towards the
                                 precipice of horror with captivating results. On the brink of adolescence, young Nino - 
                                 gentle and bemused - is queer-bashed in his hometown, yet the blame is placed on him for 
                                 his supposedly unsettling influence. His family retreats to a small town for a fresh start but
                                  it's only the beginning of their woes and discomfort.
 
                            As the forest at the edge of town seems to assert an unnatural hold over the townsfolk, Nino hears 
                            tell of Almamula, a mythological creature from Argentinian folklore that supposedly wreaks punishment
                             on those who are impure in thought and deed. Director Juan Sebasti√°n Torales weaves a fairy tale-like
                              spell in this totally original coming-of-age narrative. Nicol√°s D√≠az as Nino possesses a compelling 
                              screen presence that belies his age and is the cautious mystified centre of this delightfully dark 
                              voyage into fear, adulthood, religious control, and burgeoning desire.

                                Keisi is forbidden from being their true self in their service job at an art gallery,
                                 but the line between this institution and their identity begins to blur in Keisi's 
                                 fantasies of art and nature.
